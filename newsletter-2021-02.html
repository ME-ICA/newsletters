<h1>tedana February 2021 Update</h1>
Since our late December newsletter, we have created a new stable release available on PyPI!
You can upgrade your local installation to the latest 0.0.9 version by running <xmp>pip install -U tedana</xmp>.
We encourage everyone to go and check it out, as it includes many new bug fixes, improvements, and breaking changes.

<h2>New Contributors</h2>
We are excited to welcome three new contributors since our last newsletter: M. Versluis, Z. Ahmed, and A. Khojandi!
Thanks to all of our contributors for their continued input and help in creating tedana.
The community has now grown to 20 contributors, and we always look forward to seeing more new faces!
If you’re not sure where to start, please feel free to open an issue or join our next
<a href="https://tedana.readthedocs.io/en/latest/developing.html?highlight=developer%20call#monthly-developer-calls">monthly developer's call</a>.

<h2>Governance Updates</h2>
We have recently overhauled our governance structure, moving from a Benevolent-Dictator-for-Life (BDFL) model to a Steering committee structure.
We have also implemented specific maintainer roles to better track project leadership, and we encourage contributors to self-describe their work on tedana in the new
<a href="https://github.com/ME-ICA/tedana/blob/main/contributions.md">contributions description file</a>.
You can learn more about our new governance structure and current project leadership in
<a href="https://tedana.readthedocs.io/en/latest/governance.html">our documentation</a>.
We encourage any community members who are interested in taking a more active role in tedana to open an issue and add themselves as maintainers!
